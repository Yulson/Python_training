# Ask the user to choose one of two options:

# Let's begin by asking the user to type either 'p' or 'q'. You know how to do this using input()

# Then, begin a while loop that runs for as long as the user doesn't type 'q'.
# Inside the loop, have an if statement that checks if the user typed 'p'.
#    If they did, print "Hello"
# Still inside the loop, ask the user again
